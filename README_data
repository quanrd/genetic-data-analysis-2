All data downloaded from the original sources and processed data files
should be stored here. Large data files should not be commited to the
git repository. If small data files are committed, make sure that data
usage conditions are being correctly followed (e.g., sometimes data
files cannot be made publicly available).

NOTES

* download_genotypess.sh is a bash script that will automatically
  retrieve the genotype files from http://mtweb.cs.ucl.ac.uk.

* CFW_measures.txt contains measurements of 200 phenotypes collected
  from 2,117 CFW mice. These data accompany the Nature Genetics paper,
  "Genome-wide association of multiple complex traits in outbred mice
  by ultra-low-coverage sequencing," by Nicod et al. This file was
  downloaded from https://wp.cs.ucl.ac.uk/outbredmice.

* CFW_covariates.txt contains covariate data (e.g., sex, age, batch)
  recorded for 2,117 CFW mice. This file was downloaded from the same
  source as CFW_measures.txt.

* list_of_1934_mice_used_for_analysis.txt gives the ids of the 1,934
  mice retained for the genome-wide association analyses in Nicod et
  al (2016). This list was obtained from file
  List_of_1934_mice_used_for_analysis.RData downloaded from
  http://mtweb.cs.ucl.ac.uk/dosages. The ids were adjusted to match
  the ids in the phenotype table.
