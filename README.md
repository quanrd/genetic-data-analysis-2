**Instructor:** Peter Carbonetto

## Introduction

In this short workshop, we will use popular software tools such as
PLINK and GEMMA to generate interesting biological insights from
large-scale genetic data. In particular, we will conduct a genome-wide
association analysis to identify genetic contributors to physiological
traits in mice. (Due to data sharing restrictions, we cannot use human
data.) While anyone who is curious about the "genomics revolution" may
attend, this workshop is mainly intended to develop practical
computing skills for graduate students and other researchers working
with genetic data-concepts such as "genotype" and "allele frequency"
will not be explained. We will practice "live coding" throughout, so
please bring your laptop!

## Prerequisites

This workshop assumes participants are already familiar with R and a
UNIX-like shell environment. An RCC user account is recommended, but
not required-temporary access to the RCC cluster will be available in
class. All participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or
Windows operating system that they have administrative privileges on.
