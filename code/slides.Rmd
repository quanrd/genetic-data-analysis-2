It's your choice
================

Your may choose to...

+ Work through the examples on the RCC cluster.

+ Work through the examples on your laptop.

+ Pair up with your neighbour.

+ Follow what I do on the projector.

*However*,

1. A few of the examples will only run on the RCC cluster.

2. The examples may not produce the exact same result on your laptop.

Initial setup (part 1)
======================

+ WiFi

+ Power outlets

+ YubiKeys

+ Pace, questions (e.g., keyboard shortcuts).

Initial setup (part 2)
======================

Download the workshop packet to your laptop.

+ URL: https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/genetic-data-analysis-2

+ Open **slides.pdf** from the **docs** folder. This is useful for
viewing and copying the code from the slides.

+ We may also look at some of the files in the **code** folder. The
code can be viewed with your favourite text editor, or browsed
on GitHub.

Initial setup (part 3)
======================

If you are using the RCC cluster, set up your cluster computing
environment:

1. Connect to midway2.

    + See https://rcc.uchicago.edu/docs/connecting.
    
2. *Add sinteractive command here.*
